So earlier this year, I planed to purchase and I did order domain hary.co.id, but it was rejected by registrar. 

<!-- more -->

They said that to have .co.id ones should have NPWP badan.

I should have done it a long time ago, because I saw that some people can use their personal NPWP (but not now though) to purchase domain .co.id.

So, in the end, I purchased new domain hary.my.id.

And here it is, [hary.my.id](https://hary.my.id).
