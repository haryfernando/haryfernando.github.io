### About This Blog

I just purchased this domain (hary.my.id, ed) today, 29 Aug 2013.
More story about this domain can be found [here]({% post_url 2013-08-30-new-domain %}).

I am going to use this as my technical blog, and my old primary blog will be used for learning arabic language (hopefully).

For some of you who wants to know technical, this blog is hosted at github [pages](//pages.github.com), powered by [jekyll](//github.com/mojombo/jekyll), using [slate](//github.com/jsncostello/slate) template, and edited with `vi` on my laptop. Yup, I personally create and edit every page on this blog.


### About Me

### Update 

20 Jan 2015 : I decide to move this blog to [hary.web.id/en](http://hary.web.id/en). This is more like static page now. I will try my best to finish all unfinished pages. May Allah help me.

24 Feb 2017 : I change it back to [hary.my.id](//hary.my.id/en).
