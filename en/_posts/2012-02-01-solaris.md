This is note section for Solaris 10

### Solaris 11

I found a problem regarding su-ing in solaris 11.

    su -

I got error said:

    Roles can only be assumed by authorized users
    su: Sorry

I found the solution to this:
We need to grant root role to this user.

Only first created user (that we created during installation) has this role granted by default.

For the next user, we need to change it:

    usermod -R root oracle

Note : need to add some more.
